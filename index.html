    <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics
        at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University.</a>
        My research interests lie at the interface between causal
        inference, machine learning, and experimental design. I
        develop and apply statistical methods to solve empirical
        problems arising in tech, and public policy. Previously, I
        obtained a B.A. in Economics
        from <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/economics">Wellesley
        College</a>.

<p class="top-half">
Air pollution is known to affect health outcomes across all age groups, through direct inhalation of toxic matters. While the effect of pollution matters on extreme health outcomes are extensively studied, little is known about its causal effect on academic performances of students. I analyze the effect of air pollution on academic performances of Korean elementary/middle/high school students using an instrumental variable (IV) approach. I use wind direction as an instrument for the level of air pollution, exploiting the unique geography of Korea where pollution matters from China exogenously vary depending on the wind. I find that increase in the level of particulate matter increases the share of students who underperform in Math/Korean/English subjects, and decrease the share of students who overperform in all subjects.</p>

Journal version under review <br>
<p class="top-half">
Datasets in medicine, economics, and tech, severely lack diversity, and minority groups are often heavily underrepresented. Standard causal approaches that estimate the average treatment effect are not effective under such biases. We propose a notion of worst-case treatment effect, that guarantees uniformly good performance across all subpopulations of a given size. Our approach allows flexible use of ML models to estimate treatment effects in both randomized and observational settings. It is agnostic to particular demographic groupings, and guards against brittle findings that are invalidated by unanticipated covariate shifts.</p>

	    <li> <font color = #1B4F72> <strong>The Effect of Delayed Retirement Credit on Social Security Claiming and Employment (in progress)</strong></font> <br>
            with&nbsp;<a href="https://mgduggan.people.stanford.edu/">Mark Duggan</a>,&nbsp;Irena Dushi, &nbsp;and Gina Li<br>
          <p class="top-half">Understanding how individuals respond to incentives for delaying Social Security (SS) claiming is important from a program design perspective, due to insolvency concerns arising from rising program costs, increased life expectancy, rate of retirement among baby boomers, and decreasing birth rates. We investigate the effect of delayed retirement credit (DRC), an upward adjustment in monthly benefits that works as an incentive for individuals to delay their Social Security claiming. In aggregate, individuals do not seem to be changing their claiming behavior in response to change in DRC, despite the significant increase in benefits of claiming later. With micro SSA data, we hope to further shed light on how DRC might affect claiming and working behavior of older individuals.</p>
